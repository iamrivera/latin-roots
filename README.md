# LatinRootsII

Welcome to Latin Roots! Our CLI program is built to provide users a fun and interactive way to learn about the various cultures of Latin America. We want Latin Roots to become a repository for and celebration of all things La Vida Latina. 

The user experience is modeled after a guided travel tour. Users are assinged a profile and are introduced to their travel guide Alberto. Alberto issues prompts that help guide the users through an interactive text based tour of Latin American countries, storing and creating a passport for our travellers along the way and even assigning them Traveler Status based on their number of visits. 

The goal is to streamline the code over time and include other external data sources that can create a richer wealth of knowledge for Latin Culture. Eventually each country will have famous artists, monuments, historic moments, etc.
